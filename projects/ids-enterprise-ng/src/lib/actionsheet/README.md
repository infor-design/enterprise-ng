# SoHoXi Angular Component : Actionsheet

## Description

This component provides a simple, mobile-friendly list of available contextual actions.

In Desktop settings, Action Sheets are represented by Popupmenus. However, Action Sheet components can be configured to instead display a mobile-friendly view of this menu, which appears to roll out from the bottom of the viewport, and can easily be selected by touch.

### Usage

To add an `actionsheet` to a component requires adding the module `SohoActionsheetModule` into the hosting component.

In the markup for your angular component, simply add elements name `soho-actionsheet` in a div tag and add data for the `SohoActionSheetActions` interface. You can pass that to a setting `action` to show the button actions of the actionsheet in smaller viewport. Inside of it, you need to add the `soho-button` for the trigger element. e.g.,

```html
<div
  soho-actionsheet
  [actions]="actions">
  <button
    soho-button="tertiary"
    icon="more"
    data-init="false"
    ></button>
</div>
```

```typescript
actions: SohoActionsheetActions[] = [
  { icon: 'mail', text: 'Email' },
  { icon: 'user-profile', text: 'Go to Profile' },
  { icon: 'workflow', text: 'Share' },
  { icon: 'user-status-do-not-disturb', text: 'Remove' }
];
```
